# PRIMM Worksheet: Grouping Data

## Predict

1. What do you think the following SQL statements will do? Write your predictions.

   ```SQL
   SELECT COUNT(*)
   FROM Tracks;
   ```

   ```SQL
   SELECT genre_id, COUNT(*)
   FROM Tracks 
   GROUP BY genre_id;
   ```

   ```SQL
   SELECT genre_id, AVG(duration_ms)
   FROM Tracks 
   GROUP BY genre_id;
   ```
   
## Run

2. Execute the SQL statements in your SQL environment and observe the results.

## Investigate

3. Analyse the output of each SQL statement:
   - What information does `COUNT(*)` provide in the context of the `Tracks` table?
   - How does grouping by `genre_id` in the `Tracks` table affect the count?
   - Discuss the use of `AVG(duration_ms)` in conjunction with `GROUP BY genre_id`.

## Modify

4. Modify the SQL statements and try different queries:
   - Change the `COUNT(*)` to `COUNT(track_id)` and observe any differences.
   - Group tracks by `album_id` instead of `genre_id` and count them.
   - Use a different aggregate function (`SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, `MAX` or `MIN`), with the `GROUP BY` clause.

## Make

5. Create your own SQL queries using the learned concepts:
   - Calculate the total duration of tracks in each album.
   - Find the album with the longest average track duration.

## Save your work
After finishing this worksheet, rename your `main.sql` file to `grouping.sql` to save your work to refer to at a later date

Now create a new file called `main.sql` and move onto worksheet 5!
